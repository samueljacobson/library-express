# library-express

This follows the tutorial [How to build a REST API with Node js & Express](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKd0Rpw7O48). 

`example.js` replicates the example in the tutorial along with some notes, and `library.js` draws upon that example, namely, an API that gives the user CRUD operations with regards to books in a library.

Use nodemon to run in terminal, e.g. `nodemon library.js`
